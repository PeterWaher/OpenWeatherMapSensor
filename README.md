OpenWeatherMapSensor
======================

Simple [IEEE P1451.99](https://gitlab.com/IEEE-SA/XMPPI/IoT)-compliant sensor for educational purposes. 
Solution contains an adaptation of the **SensorXmpp2** project in the 
[Mastering Internet of Things repository](https://github.com/PeterWaher/MIoT). Sensor data is retrieved from 
[openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/). You will have to create an API key with them in order to be 
able to retrieve the data. You will also need a connection with an [IoT Broker](https://waher.se/Broker.md) for 
full IoT support. The **Neuron** from [Trust Anchor Group](https://www.trustanchorgroup.com/) supports all IoT 
Services, and more. If using a traditional [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) broker, IoT services such as Thing Registry, 
Provisioning and Decision support will not be available.

Sanbox IoT Brokers that can be used for testing and educational purposes are available at:
